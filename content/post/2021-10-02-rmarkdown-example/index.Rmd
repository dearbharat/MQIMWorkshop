```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown {.tabset .tabset-dropdown}

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the ***Knit*** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

### Summary

```{r MyfirstRmD-1, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
summary(cars)
```

### Summary2

```{r MyfirstRmD-2, echo=TRUE}
summary(cars)
```
## {.tabset}

### Summary3

```{r MyfirstRmD-3, echo=TRUE}
summary(cars)
```

### Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r MyfirstRmD-4, fig.show=FALSE, results='hide'}
plot(pressure)
```

### Notes
Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
